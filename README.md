The Prog01_aOrderedList Program

This Java program, `Prog01_aOrderedList`, manages a list of cars in an ordered list. It reads input data from a file, allowing you to add or remove cars, and then generates an output file with the updated list of cars.

## How to Use

1. **Input Data File:** Prepare an input data file (e.g., `input.txt`) with a list of operations. Each operation is specified in the format:
   - `A, Make, Year, Price`: Add a car with the specified make, year, and price.
   - `D, Make, Year`: Remove a car with the specified make and year.

2. **Compile the Code:** Compile the Java code using your preferred Java development environment or IDE.

3. **Run the Program:** Execute the program by running the `Prog01_aOrderedList` class. The program will prompt you to enter the input file name and the output file name.

4. **View the Output:** The program will generate an output file with the updated list of cars. You can view this list, along with the total number of cars.

5. **Repeat:** You can create and use different input data files to test different scenarios.

## Example Input File

Here's an example of an input file (`input.txt`):

```plaintext
A, Toyota, 2022, 25000
A, Honda, 2021, 22000
